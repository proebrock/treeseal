Mid-term
--------
* Status bar with statistics of currently displayed dir or tree
  (size/number of file/dir for each status, with 5 statuses we get 20 values!)
* Before import, check if no upper or lower node has already .dtint
* Right-Click menu
  - Dependent on previous action, e.g. import, check, ...)
  - Functions: Refresh (diff of sub-tree)
* Proper key navigation of listview (including CTRL-A, multiselect, background menu)
* Program name and artwork (icon, splash screen)
* Help: Github, in-program (HTML viewer) and About dialog
* Globally resolving issues via main menu (Accept all, accept all added, accept all deleted,
  accept all renamed, accept all ops not leading to data loss (think of multiple copies of a file
  ... or  using radiobox)
* Much more clever diffs using global checksum database (rm, mv, cp)
  (a new file can have no/one/multiple origins in terms of its checksum,
  each can still exist (cp) or no longer exist (mv) in current fs; dirs are
  handled by their contents)
* Preferences menu and saving in rc file:
  - Hide valid nodes in diff view: on/off
  - Default dir for opening directories: path
  - Black listed file patterns or paths
  - gpg signature options
* Unicode support for filenames (db stores just ansi strings?, check display of umlaute in win
* Continuously check and keep portability (Linux, Win, Mac)

Long-term
---------
* make getPathsByChecksum and getNodesByChecksum compatible with short checksum strings
  (various length support, warning for non-unique user params, optimal data structure
  for this are the so-called "Suffix-Trees")
* Copying from instance to instance
  - What can you trust, how paranoid do you have to be?
  - src checked, make dest the same VS. two or more defect copies, create one with max recovery
* Advertise program (Friends, Heise?, Linux-Magazine?)
* Sign database contents using gpg instead of just using a checksum
* Client-server architecture for copying, using rsync technology
  (e.g. with rolling checksums)
* Python 3 compatibility
