* Progress bar on diff calculation
* Right-Click menu
  - Dependent on previous action, e.g. import, check, ...)
  - Working with multi-select
  - Functions: Refresh (diff of sub-tree), Accept (update db), Compare
    (side-by-side comparison (gridview?), colored differences,
    Database (previous state) vs. Filesystem (current state))
* Double-Click on nodes (dir: change to, file: compare)
* Key navigation of listview (including multiselect and background menu)
* Split program into multiple files/modules (check Meld as example)
* Program name and artwork (icon, splash screen)
* Help Github, in-program (HTML viewer) and About dialog
* Global resolving issues (Accept all, accept all added, accept all deleted,
  accept all renamed, ...)
* Much more clever diffs using global checksum database (rm, mv, cp)
  (a new file can have no/one/multiple origins in terms of its checksum,
  each can still exist (cp) or no longer exist (mv) in current fs; dirs are
  handled by their contents)
* Preferences menu and saving in rc file:
  - Hide valid nodes in diff view: on/off
  - Default dir for opening directories: path
* Unicode support for filenames
* Continuously check and keep portability (Linux, Win, Mac)

* Copying from instance to instance
  - What can you trust, how paranoid do you have to be?
* Advertise program (Friends, Heise?, Linux-Magazine?)
* Sign database contents using gpg instead of just using a checksum
* Client-server architecture for copying, using rsync technology
  (e.g. with rolling checksums)
