Mid-term
--------
* Before import, check if no upper or lower node has already .treeseal
* More Right-Click menu functions:
  - "Open" of file with system-defined program (Windows only (?))
  - Refresh (diff of sub-tree)
  - Dependent on status:
    New -> Delete in fs (dir or file)
    Missing -> Create (dir) or Restore (based on still existing
               content or user chooses file)
    Warning/Error -> Restore (like above)
    ### Not actions for DirContainsXXX
    ### Careful with recusive behavior and mixed status trees!
* Proper key navigation of listview (including CTRL-A,
  multiselect, background menu)
* Program name and artwork (icon, splash screen)
* Help: Github, in-program (HTML viewer) and About dialog
* Globally resolving issues via main menu (Accept all, accept
  all added, accept all deleted,
  accept all renamed, accept all ops not leading to data loss (think
  of multiple copies of a file
  ... or  using radiobox)
* Much more clever diffs using global checksum database (rm, mv, cp)
  (a new file can have no/one/multiple origins in terms of its checksum,
  each can still exist (cp) or no longer exist (mv) in current fs;
  dirs are handled by their contents)
* Preferences menu and saving in rc file in .treeseal
  or somewhere else (local vs. global config):
  - Hide valid nodes in diff view: on/off
  - Default dir for opening directories: path
  - Black listed file patterns or paths
  - GPG signature options
  - Buffer size for checksum calculation
* Continuously check and keep portability (Linux, Win, Mac)
* Memory and performance profiling
* Elapsed, expected, remaining time in progress dialog

Long-term
---------
* Make getPathsByChecksum() and getNodesByChecksum() compatible with
  shorter checksum strings (various length support, warning for
  non-unique user params, optimal data structure for this are the
  so-called "Suffix-Trees")
* Console version for most important tasks, just requiring python
  (and not wxPython) e.g. runnable on Synolog Diskstation
* Copying from instance to instance
  - What can you trust, how paranoid do you have to be?
  - src checked, make dest the same VS. two or more defect copies,
    create one with max recovery
* Advertise program (Friends, Heise?, Linux-Magazine?)
* Sign database contents using gpg instead of just using a checksum
* Client-server architecture for copying, using rsync technology
  (e.g. with rolling checksums)
* Python 3 compatibility
