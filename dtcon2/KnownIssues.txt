dtint.py works thanks to Python on different platforms.

But right now it is not (yet) a real cross-platfrom application. There are still a couple of open issues when you create a database on one platform and try to check/update it on a different platform:

1) The path of the root nodes is not converted in a platform independent format, like the directory separators (all other nodes do not contain directory separators)

2) The checksum is saved in a binary format in the database, which causes trouble when using different big and little endian machines; use the "struct" module with "pack" and "unpack" methods

3) There seem to be some differences in the time stamp formats even though the printed time stamps on the console look equal. Maybe sub-seconds? Maybe another binary issue?
